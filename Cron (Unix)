Cron is a job scheduler on Unix-like operations systems.

Users who set up and mantain software enviroments use cron to schedule jobs to run periodically at fixed times.

It can be used to automate system mainentance or administration, downloading files from the internet, ...

Cron is most suitable for scheduling repetitive tasks. In case we want to schedule one-time tasks we can use the associated "at" utility.

The actions of cron are driven by a crontab (cron table) file, a configuration file that specifies shell commands to run periodically on a given schedule. These files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept. : [/var/spool/cron/crontabs]

Therefore, you can also find in the [/etc/cron.d] file that contains the different system cronjobs stored for different users.

To create a crontable you need to execute "crontab -e" to edit the default file, write the interval of time you want to use for the ".sh" to be executed along with the shell command you want to execute.

This is a perfect representation of the line should be typed:
# ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
# │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
# │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
# │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday;
# │ │ │ │ │                                   7 is also Sunday on some systems)
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# * * * * * <command to execute>
