Every UNIX directory structure is like a tree, the base of the file system hierarchy begins at "/"(root).

Directories branch off the root, but everything starts at root.

Let's start talking about the subdirectories of root: [Most common ones]

/ = The directory called "root", the starting point of the file hierarchy.

/bin : Directory where you wil find binary o executable files. (Programs, applications, commands, ...)

/etc : Directory where configuration lives, these files control how the system or programs behave.

/home : Directory where user home directories are located, these subdirectories allow users to have their own data and separate it from other users.

/opt : Directory where optional and third party software live, software that is not bundled with the operating system will be often installed in /opt.

/tmp = Directory where temporary space is allocated, most linux distributions clear its content at boot time, it is not a good idea to keep important files there.

/usr = Directory where several subdirectories are stored, they contain UNIX commands and data files.

/var = Directory that contains data such as log files, specifically, the var/log directory contains logs generated by the operating system and other applications.
